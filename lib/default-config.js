            body: "After a major storm damaged our roof, we were stressed about finding a reliable contractor. From the first phone call to the final inspection, the team was professional and transparent. They walked us through every step, helped us navigate the insurance claim, and completed the job in just three days. Our new roof looks fantastic and we haven't had a single leak since. Highly recommend!",

What impressed me most was how they took the time to explain the ventilation improvements they were making. The whole process was smooth and our energy bills have actually gone down since the installation!",

They provided a detailed quote with no hidden fees, finished ahead of schedule, and the quality of work is outstanding. Our neighbors have been asking who did our roof because it looks so good. Worth every penny!",

They found and fixed issues I didn't even know existed, including some wood rot that could have become a major problem. Their honesty and craftsmanship have earned a customer for life.",

            body: "We had three different companies give us estimates, and while they weren't the cheapest, they were definitely the most thorough. The project manager took photos throughout the entire process and sent us daily updates. They also spotted and repaired some flashing issues around our chimney at no extra charge. Six months later and our roof still looks brand new. Couldn't be happier!",

We went with their premium shingles and the transformation is incredible. The crew was respectful of our property, worked efficiently even in the summer heat, and left our yard cleaner than they found it. Outstanding service from start to finish!",
